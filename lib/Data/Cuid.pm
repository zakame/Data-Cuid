=head1 NAME

Data::Cuid - collision-resistant IDs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Cuid qw(cuid slug);

    my $id   = cuid();          # cjg0i57uu0000ng9lwvds8vb3
    my $slug = slug();          # uv1nlmi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Cuid> is a port of the cuid JavaScript library for Perl.

Collision-resistant IDs (also known as I<cuids>) are optimized for
horizontal scaling and binary search lookup performance, especially for
web or mobile applications with a need to generate tens or hundreds of
new entities per second across multiple hosts.

C<Data::Cuid> does not export any functions by default.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 cuid

    my $cuid = cuid();

Produce a cuid as described in L<the original JavaScript
implementation|https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid#broken-down>.  This
cuid is safe to use as HTML element IDs, and unique server-side record
lookups.

=head2 slug

    my $slug = slug();

Produce a shorter ID in nearly the same fashion as L</cuid>.  This slug
is good for things like URL slug disambiguation (i.e., C<<
example.com/some-post-title-<slug> >>) but is absolutely not recommended
for database unique IDs.
